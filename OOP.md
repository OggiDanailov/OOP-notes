Object Oriented JS

In this lecture I will talk about what is an object, what is a object programming, what is objet inheritance and finally classes from ES6

Object oriented programming 
this is an approch in programming (and this is not only JS) where you wrap your functionality in Objects. The advantage of this approach is that it allows you to:
 - you don't have to duplicate your code;
 - the different stages or attributes in your code will be separated;
 - creating snippets of code wrapped in an object will allow you to reuse easily this code.
 - your code is much more clear

 Javascript is prototype-based language (which is not true anymore). It means that in Javascript you make prototype objects, and then make new instances based on this prototype objects.
 That's the reason why in JS everything is an object apart from primitive data type:
 - string
- number
- boolean
- null - it is an assignment value; can be assigned to a variable
- undefined - variable has been created but nothing has been assigned; it represents no value

delegation in prototype-based languages is the equivalent of inheritance in class-based languages.
