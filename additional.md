imperative which allows side effects,
functional which disallows side effects,
declarative which does not state the order in which operations execute,
object-oriented which groups code together with the state the code modifies,
procedural which groups code into functions,
logic which has a particular style of execution model coupled to a particular style of syntax and grammar, and
symbolic programming which has a particular style of syntax and grammar
